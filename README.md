## Description

For our final project, we decided to build a childhood classic. Mash. If you're unfamiliar with MASH, I recommend checking out [this tutorial](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-M.A.S.H)

The motivation for this project was to create and deploy a full stack application, connecting everything we have learned and applying it in a team setting.

The project was built for people looking to feel like a kid again, playing a silly game you use to as a kid which is why we chose to go with the retro theme.

This project allows users to create an account and share their results with desired friends, while creating a personalized yet random scenario for pure enjoyment.on

The technologies we used for the project were:

- React with TypeScript for the frontend.
- Node.js with Express.js and GraphQL for the backend.
- MongoDB & Mongoose ODM for the DB and Object Data Modeling
- Heroku for deployment.

## Instructions

When starting you will choose between logging-in/Signing-up or go straight to the fun. Once in you will begin personalizing your MASH choices. Once you have completed all 6 Categories, you can generate your MASH. When logged into your account you are able to save your prior results as well as share the results to your friends.
