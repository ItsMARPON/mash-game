#### Description

The project motivation was to create and deploy a full functioning full stack application, connecting everything we have learned and applying it in a team setting.

The project was built for people looking to feel like a kid again, playing a silly game you use to as a kid which is why we chose to go with the retro theme.

This project allows users to create an account and share their results with desired friends, while creating a personalized yet random scenario for pure enjoyment.on

The technologies we used for the project were, React, TypeScript for front end. Using GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js for the server. The Database used MongoDB, and Mongoose ODM.Lastly the project was deployed to Heroku.
